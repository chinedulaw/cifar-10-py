load Cifar-10,Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST and MNIST dataset from local
file/directory.see usage.py for details on how to use the programs.

CIFAR-10
Cifar-10 is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition.
it is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning.
cifar-10 is a labeled subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset. 
More details about Cifar-10 can be found here:

FASHION-MNIST
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of zalando's article mages consisting of a training set
of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as
a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset to benchmark Machine Learning algorithms,
as it shares the same image size and the structure of training and testing splits.
The dataset is hosted on github.

KMNIST
KMNIST dataset is a drop-in replacement for MNIST datset .KMNIST dataset is created by
ROIS-DS center for open Data in the Humanities (CODH), based on Kuzushuji Dataset created
by National institute of Japanese literature.The dataset is hosted on github.
